# Template for make a demo project with React/Redux

This project include ...

> Babel standalone

> Bootstrap

> React

> Redux

> Font-awesome

  

You must use a http server for that babel works, I use python3 http server and run it in this folder:

  

    python3 -m http.server

  

Or

  

    npm run server (if you have nodejs installed).

  

then open your browser to URL http://127.0.0.1:8000.

  

You can use SASS with visual studio code plugin "scss-to-css" and its wonderful auto-compile on save feature!.

  

and finally this project has a ugly example counter for demostrative purposes.
